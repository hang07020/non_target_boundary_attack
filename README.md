# non_target_boundary_attack
This repository contains the code for a graduation thesis on the application of Boundary Attack in the field of image recognition. The project utilizes Python and Keras to generate attacks against a ResNet50 model, performing image preprocessing, calculating differences, and evaluating adversarial samples from red/green/blue images and others.
